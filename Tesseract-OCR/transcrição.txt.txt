 

How is Nylon Fabric Made?

1. Extraction of Diamine Acid

A monomer, called diamine acid, is extracted from crude oil.

2. Combining

Diamine acid is forced to enter into a reaction with adipic acid
to create a polymer, known as nylon salt.

3. Heating

This crystallized substance is then heated to form a molten
substance.

4. Extrusion

This substance is then extruded through a metal spinneret.

5. Loading

It is then loaded onto a type of spool called a bobbin.

6. Stretching

These ﬁbers are then stretched to increase their
strength and elasticity.

7. Drawing

They are then wound onto another spool in a process
called "drawing".

8. Spinning

The resulting ﬁbers are ready to be spun into garments or other
forms of ﬁbers.

9. Finishing

It is then dyed to produce the color that is desired for the
end product.
